Next-Door HelpCom (Helper Community)

A cross-platform application for mobile devices that connects neighbors within a certain range. This allows neighbors to interact better with each other.

The basic idea is that people can post their “requirements” or ask for “help” ,in the app, from their neighbourhood. Of course, this platform can be used in various ways as desired.

The Person who helps you gets a point , which will be publicly visible through a laderboard. Also , a “Rating-System “ within the profile as in Google Maps is conceivable.
